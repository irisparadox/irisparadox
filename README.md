### **Software & Hardware** Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub profile!
- 🎓 I am currently a _Computer Engineering_ student at **Complutense University of Madrid**, in Spain.
- 🌱 I tend to code lots of things, mostly data structures and algorithms in **c/c++ and Java**.
- 💻 I also design hardware stuff. You can check [this repository](https://github.com/irisparadox/BOPPBIPP3), which is a 32 bit custom CPU made in VHDL.
- ⚡ I love astronomy, art, and music. I am a 3D artist too, with many years of experience on modeling.
- 🎶 You can check my spotify page [here](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2Ubm853gnUsFHOgZxQoQxd)!
